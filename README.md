# Bitmatrix-CPP
A templated  bit -matrix class extending from the STL- bit set class.


This project implements a  homebrewed 2D- Bitmatrix class extending from the STL- Library Bitset classes. It composed  templated STL arrays  containing bitset to create  a 2D bit-matrix class. Bitmatrix is a templated type deduce at compile time and cannot change it size once the bitmatrix is created

1)Requires visual studio 2019 to use ,if you want to use it visual studio 2019.
2)Otherwise for other platforms such as GCC, only include the header and source files only.
